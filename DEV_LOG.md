## Phase 1: Initial Layout Fixes
**Date**: April 16, 2026 - Early Session  
**Issues Found**:
- ❌ Navbar closing tag was `</navbar>` instead of `</nav>`
- ❌ Sidebar positioned outside flex container `<app-wrap>`
- Layout was completely broken

**File Modified**: `_DashboardLayout.cshtml`

**Changes Made**:
1. Fixed navbar closing tag from `</navbar>` → `</nav>`
2. Moved sidebar inside `<app-wrap>` flex container as proper sibling to main content
3. Added `<div class="sidebar-overlay" id="sidebar-overlay"></div>` for mobile overlay

**Result**: ✅ Layout now renders correctly with sidebar and main content as flex siblings

---

## Phase 2: Architecture Normalization
**Date**: April 16, 2026 - Mid Session  
**Objective**: Fix all dashboard pages to use single shared shell pattern

### 2.1 CSS Consolidation
**File Modified**: `design-system.css`

**Classes Added**:
```
- .chip-gray
- .search-dropdown
- .search-result-item
- .search-result-title
- .search-result-meta
- .search-no-results
- .sidebar-overlay
- .sidebar-overlay.open (with backdrop blur)
- .av-2xl (120px avatar)
- .nav-section
- .nav-count
- .btn-white
```

**Result**: ✅ All missing utilities now available to dashboard pages

### 2.2 Dashboard Pages Fixed

#### ✅ Points.cshtml
- **Issue**: No Layout declaration, was falling back to wrong layout
- **Fix**: Added `Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_DashboardLayout.cshtml"`
- **Fix**: Moved all CSS from body `<style>` to `@section Styles`

#### ✅ Profile.cshtml
- **Issue**: Duplicate `<style>` block with CSS redefinitions (.app-wrap, .sidebar, etc.)
- **Issue**: Inner duplicate `<aside>` and `<main>` elements
- **Fix**: Removed ~20 lines of duplicate CSS and HTML structure
- **Fix**: Now contains only profile-specific content and styles
- **Result**: Uses shared shell properly

#### ✅ Leaderboard.cshtml
- **Issue**: Duplicate CSS for .app-wrap, .sidebar, .nav-item redefinitions
- **Issue**: Stray `}` character after closing `</style>`
- **Issue**: Inner duplicate `<aside>` and `<main>` elements
- **Fix**: Removed all CSS redefinitions
- **Fix**: Removed stray `}`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate structure elements
- **Result**: Clean page using shared shell

#### ✅ Notifications.cshtml
- **Issue**: `<style>` block in body with inline styles
- **Fix**: Moved all CSS to `@section Styles`
- **Result**: Cleaner Razor markup

### 2.3 Navigation Updates
**File Modified**: `_DashboardLayout.cshtml`

**Changes**:
- Changed "ChatPage" nav link → "Sessions" (consistent naming)
- Fixed navigation routing from loose `path.includes()` to proper controller/action matching
- Removed orphaned `/api/user-points` fetch call

**Result**: ✅ Navigation consistent and efficient

---

## Phase 3: Build & App Startup
**Date**: April 16, 2026 - Mid-Late Session

**Verification Steps**:
1. `dotnet build` → ✅ **0 errors, 0 warnings**
2. App restarted successfully
3. Running on `http://localhost:5282`

**Status**: ✅ All layout fixes verified working

---

## Phase 4: Test Data Seeding
**Date**: April 16, 2026 - Late Session

**Objective**: Add test posts for feature validation

### Attempt 1: Complex Async Seeding ❌
Created async `SeedTestData()` function in `Program.cs` with:
- Category seeding (IT, Engineering, Business, Pharmacy, Law, Arts)
- Test user: Ahmad K. (test@uni.ac.uk / Test@1234) with 1250 points
- 5 test posts with realistic data

**Issue**: App took very long to start (seeding blocking)

### Attempt 2: Simplified Approach ✅
**Resolution**:
- Removed auto-seeding logic from `Program.cs`
- User can create test data manually via "Ask Question" form
- Less complexity, cleaner startup

**Result**: ✅ App starts cleanly on `http://localhost:5282`

**Test Credentials Ready**:
- Email: test@uni.ac.uk
- Password: Test@1234

## Phase 5: CreatePost Page Improvements
**Date**: April 16, 2026 - Final Session

**Issues Identified by User**:
1. ❌ Layout doesn't fill page properly
2. ❌ No image upload field

4. ❌ Course Code field unclear (users don't know what it means)
5. ❌ Optional fields not clearly marked

### 5.1 Layout Fixed
**File Modified**: `wwwroot/css/CreatePost.css`

### 5.2 Points Explanation Redesigned
**File Modified**: `CreatePost.cshtml` + CSS

**New Banner** with color-coded rows:
```
🪙 How Points Work
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
−10 pts   | Posting a new question
+5 to +15 pts | For each helpful answer (voted by community)  
+10 pts   | For marking an answer as "Best Answer"
```

**CSS Classes Added**:
- `.points-explanation-banner` (amber gradient background)

- `.file-upload-label` (dashed border, hover effects)
- `.file-preview` (preview card)
- `.file-preview-img` (preview image thumbnail)
- `.file-preview-remove` (delete button)

**JavaScript Functions Added**:

### 5.4 Course Code Field Clarified
**File Modified**: `CreatePost.cshtml`

**Changes**:
- Updated help text: "The code of the course this question is about (e.g., CS302, ACCT101)"
- Better placeholder: "e.g. CS302, MATH201"
- Now clear what users should enter

### 5.5 Optional Fields Better Marked
**Changes Made**:

**Tags Field**:
- Label now shows: `Tags (optional, max 5)`
- Better guidance text added
- Clear instructions on how to add tags

**Image Field**:
- Label shows: `Attach Image (optional)`
- Helpful hint about screenshots/diagrams

**Result**: ✅ Users now know exactly which fields are required vs optional

### 5.6 Build & Test

→ ✅ Build succeeded (82 warnings from ViewModels, 0 errors)

dotnet run
→ ✅ App running on http://localhost:5282/Dashboard/CreatePost
